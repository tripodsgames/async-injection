New Feature: Allow alternate polyfill for Reflect API  
WARNING: This is a a breaking change release.  
The API and code have not changed, but you will need to explicitly import a polyfill into your own code in order to use this release (see the ReadMe).  
Previously Async-Injection relied on reflect-metadata (which is still supported), but this release also allows for the use of alternative implementations such as:  
    core-js (core-js/es7/reflect)
    reflection

Merge PR [ESLINT integration + Improvements](https://github.com/pcafstockf/async-injection/pull/9).  
Update devDependencies.  
Resolved a couple of eslint warnings.  
tsc no longer removes comments in generated code.  This can cause problems with post-processing tools such as istanbul. If file size is of concern to you, you should probably be minifying anyway.
